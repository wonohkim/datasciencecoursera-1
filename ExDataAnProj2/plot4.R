###Code for plot 4

### Across the United States, 
### how have emissions from coal combustion-related sources changed from 1999â€“2008?

## Read the required .RDS files
NEI <- readRDS("summarySCC_PM25.rds")
SCC <- readRDS("Source_Classification_Code.rds")

# Get coal combustion related sources from EI.Sector data 
# -> I checked every variable and this was the one with fuel comb -coal
# which is the coal combustion-related sources 
coal<-grep("coal",tolower(SCC$EI.Sector))   # Get the row number where the name coal is found
coal<-as.character(SCC[coal,1])             # Get the SCC numbers for the identified rows
data<-data.frame()                          # Loop to extract all observations that have a SCC number related to coal combustion
for (i in 1:length(coal)) {
